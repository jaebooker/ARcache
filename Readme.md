ArCache renders 3D caches based on location and scanned detected objects.

To register a cache, use the app to create one, and it's location and notes will be saved in our database. Then you have two different options to register it.

1. Use Arkit's Scanner (can be downloaded here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/scanning_and_detecting_3d_objects) to scan the object you want the cache to appear on top of, then send the scanned object to jaeson.booker@students.makeschool.com. Only available to developers!

2. (Easier way) Request a special sticker to place on a vertical surface where you want the Arcache to be, by sending a request to jaeson.booker@students.makeschool.com.
