Welcome to ArCache!

Search for augmented reality 'geocaches' all around the world or submit your own!

Put secrets inside, such as gaming codes, steam keys, or cryptocurrency addresses!

ArCache renders 3D caches based on location and scanned detected objects.

To register a cache, use the app to create one, and it's location and notes will be saved in our database.

Then use Arkit's Scanner (can be downloaded here: ) to scan the object you want the cache to appear on top of, then send the scanned object to jaeson.booker@students.makeschool.com!

In the future, we hope to integrate the scanner into our app.
